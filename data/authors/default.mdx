I am a Full Stack Developer with experience in eCommerce platforms, scalable backend services, and modern web applications. I have a strong focus on architecture, performance, and delivering high-quality solutions in production environments.

I combine technical expertise with agile leadership experience, allowing me to contribute not only to system design and technical decisions but also to team organization and efficiency. I am motivated to work in teams that value clean code, shared responsibility, and continuous improvement.

I aim to contribute in environments where I can participate in technical decision-making, system optimization, and sustainable product growth.

Outside of work, I value maintaining a healthy balance between technology and personal life. I enjoy flying drones, exploring new technology, watching good movies, and spending quality time with my family and loved ones. Sports are an important part of my routine, and meditation helps me stay focused and mentally clear. I believe a well-balanced developer builds better solutions.
