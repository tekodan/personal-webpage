## What I do

I build production-ready digital products across backend and frontend, with a strong focus on scalability, performance, and long-term maintainability.

## How I work

I combine hands-on engineering with product and delivery discipline. I care about clean architecture, clear ownership, and collaborative teams that continuously improve how they ship.

## Outside work

Outside of work, I value balance and focus. I enjoy sports, drones, learning new technology, and spending quality time with family and friends.
